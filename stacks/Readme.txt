Stacks notes from aditya verma through youtube.

Identification:
    1.Array + Nearest
    2.two for loops with i from 1 to n and j from 1 to i.

then trying through stack solution is probably a good idea.

No point in solving many questions without understanding root question.

aditya verma's idea suggests that many questions are zig zagged version of one parent question.

whose Identification would improve problem solving capabilities.

total 13 questions were suggested/taught.

(---------standard question------)

    1.a.Nearest Greater to left
    1.b.Nearest Greater to right
    1.c.Nearest Smaller to left
    1.d.Nearedt smaller to right

(-------question pattern dependant 1 ---)
    2.a.stock span problem
    2.b.maximum area of histogram

(--------final pattern question based on 1 and 2-----)
    3.Maximum area of rectangle in binary matrix

-----Good to solve-----
4.Rain Water trapping
5.Implementing a min stack
6.Implementing stack using heap
7.the celebrity problem
8.Longest valid parenthesis
9.Iterative tower of Hanoi
